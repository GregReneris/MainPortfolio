# Index and home page:

I'm using the home page to describe a bit about myself and including a picture. Travel is a huge part of my life, so I wanted that to pop out immediately with the background.

The tools I've used to create this page are html, css, and javascript.
Bootstrap is the framework I've chosen to use. I incorporated a nav-bar and linked buttons to my other pages. This site runs on ReactJS.

## Contact page:

The contact page is to provide a future employer an easy way to contact me.

## Portfolio page:

This page exhibits my work so far, and is easily updated to include more exciting projects in the future!
